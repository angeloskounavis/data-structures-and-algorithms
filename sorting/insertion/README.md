# insertion sort

# Challenge Summary

- insertion sort will look through the list of numbers and sort it out. It works by starting at the first number.
- Once it figured out what the first number is it will move to the second one and determine if it's greater than the number to the left of it.
- If it is, it will stay in place. If not, then it will move to the left one spot till it is greater than the number to the left.
