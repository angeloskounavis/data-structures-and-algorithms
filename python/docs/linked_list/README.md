# Singly Linked List
 Short summary or background information
-  We had to create a linked list class which has references the number of reference the node has

## Challenge
Description of the challenge
- Create a Linked List class. Within your Linked List class, include these methods. Insert, include, to string.
- insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
 What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach?

## API
Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List
- insert will add a new node with the nodes value to the head.
- includes will tell me whether a value exists in a node. (current maybe?)
- string will put everything above together.
